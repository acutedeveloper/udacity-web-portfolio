# Nigel Portfolio Website Udacity Project

A udacity web project to demonstrate an understanding of the things taught in the
first segment of the course: The Building Blocks of Frontend Development.

## Development process

I have made efforts to use vanilla css without a framework.

I have relied on the css naming convention of BEM (Block Element Modifier).

I have used a CSS reset to normalise the style across browsers

The layout uses mobile first css along with flexbox to progressively update the layout.

Image are fully responsive using a grunt task to resize and optimise the images.
